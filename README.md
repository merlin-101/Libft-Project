# Libft-Project
Greetings!
This is the first 42 School Project where I had to create my own library in C from scratch, according to the rules mentioned in the subject.

The final evaluation: <a href="https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42"><img src="https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/cla8uzfs700300fjvl6vylf5s/project/2848788" alt="rnarciso's 42 Libft Score" /></a>
